# Telegram Bot

Telegram entry point for the Job Agent platform. The bot guides candidates through uploading their CV, kicks off the backend LangGraph workflows, and streams progress updates directly in chat.

## Capabilities

- `/upload` via PDF document upload to sanitize CVs through the PII removal workflow.
- `/search` command that orchestrates scraping, filtering, and processing jobs while reporting progress.
- `/essays` command to view all stored essays with pagination (5 per page, newest first).
- `/add_essay` command to store question-answer pairs in the essay database for hybrid search retrieval.
- `/status` and `/cancel` commands for monitoring or stopping long-running searches.
- Rich summaries of relevant jobs, including extracted skills generated by the backend workflows.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or newer.
- `JOB_AGENT_BOT_TOKEN` from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather).
- Backend requirements satisfied for `job-agent-backend`, including `OPENAI_API_KEY`, database connectivity (`DATABASE_URL`), and any scrapper service credentials (see the backend README for details).
- Optional: Docker environment if you prefer containerized execution (`Dockerfile` and `entrypoint.sh` are provided).

## Installation

From the monorepo root:

```bash
pip install -e packages/job-agent-backend
pip install -e packages/telegram_bot
```

With development extras:

```bash
pip install -e "packages/telegram_bot[dev]"
```

## Configuration

Place required settings in a `.env` file at the repository root (loaded automatically by `main.py`):

```bash
JOB_AGENT_BOT_TOKEN=123456:example-token-from-botfather
# Additional scrapper service variables as required by job-agent-backend
```

### Access Control

Optionally restrict bot access to specific Telegram users:

```bash
# Comma-separated list of allowed Telegram user IDs
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS=123456789,987654321
```

- If not set or empty, all users can access the bot (default behavior).
- Unauthorized users are silently ignored (no response).
- To find your Telegram user ID, message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).
- Invalid entries (non-numeric values) are logged and skipped.

Ensure the database is migrated before running the bot. The provided Docker entrypoint runs Alembic migrations for you.

## Usage

```bash
python -m telegram_bot.main
```

After the bot starts:

1. Send your CV as a PDF document to store a sanitized copy for later searches.
2. Run `/search` to trigger the end-to-end pipeline. All parameters are optional:
   - `salary=5000` - Minimum salary filter (default: 4000)
   - `employment=remote` - Employment type (default: remote)
   - `days=7` - Search jobs from last N days
   - `timeout=30` - Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)
3. Use `/status` to check progress or `/cancel` to stop the current search.

### Adding Essays

Use `/add_essay` to store question-answer pairs in the essay database. Essays are indexed for hybrid search (vector similarity + full-text) and can be retrieved later for job application assistance.

**Message Format:**

```
/add_essay Question: <your question>
Answer: <your answer>
```

Or answer-only format:

```
/add_essay Answer: <your answer>
```

**Examples:**

```
/add_essay Question: What is your leadership experience?
Answer: I led a team of 5 engineers for 2 years at Acme Corp, delivering 3 major product releases on schedule.
```

```
/add_essay Answer: I have 10 years of experience in backend development using Python and Go.
```

**Notes:**

- The `Answer:` marker is required; `Question:` is optional.
- Markers are case-insensitive (`answer:`, `ANSWER:`, `Answer:` all work).
- Essays are global (shared across all users).
- Embeddings are auto-generated on save for vector search capability.
- On success, the bot replies with the essay ID for reference.

### Viewing Essays

Use `/essays` to browse all stored essays with pagination.

**Features:**

- Displays 5 essays per page, sorted by creation date (newest first)
- Shows question, answer preview (first ~100 characters), and keywords for each essay
- Navigation via "Previous" and "Next" inline buttons
- Page indicator shows current position (e.g., "Page 1 of 3")
- Message updates in place when navigating (no new messages)

**Example:**

```
/essays
```

The bot responds with a formatted list like:

```
Page 1 of 3

1. What is your leadership experience?
   I led a team of 5 engineers for 2 years at Acme Corp, delivering 3 major...
   Keywords: leadership, team management, engineering

2. Describe your backend experience.
   I have 10 years of experience in backend development using Python and Go...
   Keywords: backend, python, go

...

[Previous] [Next]
```

### Automatic Date Range Calculation

When the `days` parameter is omitted, the backend automatically determines the search date range:

- **If jobs exist in database**: Uses the `updated_at` timestamp of the most recent stored job as the cutoff date
- **If no jobs exist**: Defaults to the last 5 days
- **5-day cap**: If the last job is older than 5 days, the search is capped at 5 days to prevent excessive scraping after extended inactivity

This "resume from last search" behavior ensures you pick up where you left off without fetching duplicate jobs.

To override this behavior, explicitly provide the `days` parameter (e.g., `/search days=3`).

Note: The date calculation logic is handled by `JobAgentOrchestrator` in the backend, not by the bot itself. The bot simply passes the `days` parameter (or `None` if not specified) to the orchestrator.

### Docker

```bash
cd packages/telegram_bot
docker build -t job-agent-telegram-bot .
docker run --env-file ../../.env job-agent-telegram-bot
```

The container entrypoint applies jobs-repository migrations before starting the bot.

## Development

- `pytest` once tests are added (project scaffold is ready for it).
- `ruff format src/` for formatting.
- `ruff check src/` for linting.
